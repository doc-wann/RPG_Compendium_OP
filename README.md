# RPG_Compendium_OP
The idea of the program is having a "interactive copilot" for my RPG sessions, where players can read world-info and keep track of their investigation. The first prototype is meant to be executed without graphical interface, nor http implementation. It is just a logical companion.

Next-steps-in-develpment:

1- Enable dinamic data creation and capability to read files (create digital backups for the data entries).
2- Make a template manager for data entries, that auto-classifies and builds their "style".
